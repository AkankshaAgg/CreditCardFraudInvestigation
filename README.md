# CreditCardFraudInvestigation

In this project, two models are used:
* Unsupervised deep learning model: Self Organising Maps
* Supervised deep learning model: Artificial Neural Networks

Self Organising Map is used to find the frauds and Artificial Neural Network is used to predict the probabilities of fraud.
